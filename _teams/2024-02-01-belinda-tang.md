Hey there, I'm Belinda Tang: a graduate student and researcher at the University of Southern California (USC), joining the TRG from the vibrant city of Los Angeles. I'm on a perpetual journey of learning, exploring, and building value, with aspirations to explore the limitless possibilities of the digital cosmos!

# What am I doing today?
My focus right now is on a research project centered around quantifying the value of data and conceptualizing extensive data exchanges. I'm exploring the transformative influence of emerging technologies, notably Federated Learning, in the domain of democratized data dissemination and its implications for AI development. My research objectives include addressing disparities in AI development due to unequal access to data, exploring federated learning network structures for entities lacking formal avenues for data acquisition, and assessing the implications of data privacy laws on dataset dissemination.

# What I was up to in the past?

### Waymo Computer Vision Project
I was a AI engineer on a project focused on autonomous lane navigation using Waymo's open dataset, powered by OpenCV and FAIR's detectron2 backbone module.

### FDA Open Source Compliance Database Analysis
I've helped craft a comprehensive data analytics scheme in Python for the FDA's open source pre-market compliance database.

### Aerial Cinematography
As a self-taught drone pilot, mechanic, and tinkerer, I've been soaring the skies since 2016. Check out some of my most memorable aerial snaps from my travels.

# How about a little fun?
I'm a 21-year-old with a knack for spontaenously jet-setting around the world. Growing up in various countries, I've become a bit of a third culture gremlin. When I'm not immersed in the tech world, you'll find me pursuing my passions for soccer, aviation, rock climbing, language learning, and scuba diving. Oh, and did I mention I speak 4 languages with a 5th in the works and took a leap over the ocean skydiving in Australia? I'm always ready for the next adventure! ðŸš€
