I"Š<p>Hi! Iâ€™m James â€” a researcher at IVG focused on the implementation of AI in clinical settings. Iâ€™m deeply fascinated by the intersection of technology and healthcare. I joined IVG as Iâ€™m bullish on the violet teaming ethos of our approach to new technologies â€” incorporating a comprehensive range of stakeholders within settings like a hospital or medical clinic is the only way to convert research into tangible value.</p>

<h1 id="what-am-i-doing-today">What am I doing today?</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m a full-time student at Dr. Dre &amp; Jimmy Iovineâ€™s innovation school at USC. Though they never went to college themselves, they built a school around their learnings working at Apple, merging the liberal arts with technology.</p>

<p>I like to keep myself busy in and outside the classroom. I founded and currently lead USCâ€™s top creative organization â€” The OK Foundation. Weâ€™ve raised thousands of dollars, built incredible creative projects and formed relationships with Notion, Webflow, Meow Wolf, Bumble, Boxed Water, Iovine &amp; Young Academy and other incredible organizations. Iâ€™ve also pursued my creative interests more formally in the entertainment industry. Iâ€™ve studied under Jim Gianopulos (fmr head of 20th Century Fox/Paramount), Andy Cadiff (Director of Home Improvement) and Steven Brookman (Partner at CAA). I was a former extern at the United Talent Agency and then joined a former agent to build out the talent practice at Canal, an ecommerce platform for top celebrities and creators.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also deeply interested in the future of education and learning environments. Iâ€™ve conducted research under Dr. Thanassis Rikakis (Dean of the USC Iovine &amp; Young Academy) and Dr. SeoYoon Sung on learning innovation at the community. I also lead the community programming at the Iovine &amp; Young Academy â€” hosting events, leading tours and overall developing more curated engagements for our prospective &amp; current students.</p>

<p>I love what it means to be a student â€” to be a beginner, to look at things from a fresh perspective and to be perpetually absorbing new insights and learnings.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-was-up-to-in-the-past">What I was up to in the past?</h1>

<p>I pitched and led an internal venture at Zappos when I was 16 (a deeply formative experience), worked on growth at a Y Combinator and AARP-backed startup (Mighty Health) and did a short stint at SAP in marketing ops.</p>

<p>I actually grew up wanting to become a doctor because it allowed me to do things 1) work with people I admired and 2) have some tangible impact in my work. In junior year of high school, I got my first introduction to a startup â€” Zappos. Since then, Iâ€™ve been very fortunate to work with some really incredible people to do some really incredible things.</p>

<h1 id="how-about-a-little-fun">How about a little fun?</h1>

<p>Iâ€™m fanatical about great music &amp; great films &amp; great art. My favorite artist is Bob Dylan, but my deepest love is for classical music. Mahler, Wagner and Sibelius have a special palce in my heart. My favorite films are Make Way for Tomorrow (1937) and Yi YI (2000). My favorite artists are Bruegel, Ruscha, Duchamp, Rembrandt and Kandinsky.</p>
