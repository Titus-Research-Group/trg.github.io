I"´<p>Hi! Iâ€™m James â€” a researcher at IVG focused on the implementation of AI in clinical settings. Iâ€™m deeply fascinated by the intersection of technology and healthcare. I joined IVG as Iâ€™m bullish on the violet teaming ethos of our approach to new technologies â€” incorporating a comprehensive range of stakeholders within settings like a hospital or medical clinic is the only way to convert research into tangible value.</p>
