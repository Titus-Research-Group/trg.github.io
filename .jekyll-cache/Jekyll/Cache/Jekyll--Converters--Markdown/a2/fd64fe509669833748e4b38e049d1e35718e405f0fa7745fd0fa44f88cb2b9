I"È<p>Hello everyone! My name is Eva Alderman and my career thus far began in the lab developing some of the first ever CAR-T therapies, and has since woven through various â€œtechbioâ€ companies working on both wet &amp; dry lab products. I got bitten by the startup bug early and have loved working on projects with the potential to turn the â€˜previously impossibleâ€™ into the â€˜suddenly possibleâ€™. This interest has motivated me to join the TRG!</p>
